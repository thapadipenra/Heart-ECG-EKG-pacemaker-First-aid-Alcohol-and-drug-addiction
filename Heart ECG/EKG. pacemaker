1 brugada syndrome
Brugada (brew-GAH-dah) syndrome is a rare, but potentially life-threatening heart rhythm disorder that is sometimes inherited. People with Brugada syndrome have an increased risk of having irregular heart rhythms beginning in the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles).


2 electrolyte imbalance
An electrolyte imbalance is caused when you lose a large amount of body fluids. For example, if you are sweating or vomiting too much, it can lower the levels of some electrolytes in the body. In fact, when you're sweating, you lose 2% to 6% of your body weight.

3 wpw syndrome
In Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, an extra electrical pathway between your heart's upper chambers and lower chambers causes a rapid heartbeat. In Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, an extra signaling pathway between the heart's upper and lower chambers causes a fast heartbeat (tachycardia).

4 heart block
Heart block is a condition where the heart beats more slowly or with an abnormal rhythm. It's caused by a problem with the electrical pulses that control how your heart beats. On this page we talk about atrioventricular (AV) heart block. Find out more about other types of heart block from the British Heart Foundation.

5 arrhythmia
A heart arrhythmia (uh-RITH-me-uh) is an irregular heartbeat. Heart rhythm problems (heart arrhythmias) occur when the electrical signals that coordinate the heart's beats don't work properly. The faulty signaling causes the heart to beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia) or irregularly.

6 acute pericarditis
Acute pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium (the flexible two-layered sac that envelops the heart) that begins suddenly, is often painful, and causes fluid and blood components such as fibrin, red blood cells, and white blood cells to enter the pericardial space.

7 myocardial infarction
A heart attack (myocardial infarction) happens when one or more areas of the heart muscle don't get enough oxygen. This happens when blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked.

8 atrial enlargement
[1] Left atrial enlargement (LAE) is the hallmark of the structural remodeling process, which occurs in response to chronic pressure and volume overload. LAE occurs most commonly in association with diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, mitral valvular disease, and systemic hypertension.

9 ventricular hypertrophy
Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. This thickening may result in elevation of pressure within the heart and sometimes poor pumping action. The most common cause is high blood pressure.
